Was asked to enter in the following code:
while True:
    for i in ["/","-","|","\\",","|"]:
        print "%s\r" % i,

What this code did was creating a spinning slash, that could be used when waiting for a process to complete. We will revisit this later.


Tasks:

1. Memorize all escape sequences by putting them on flash cards

2. Use ''' (triple-single-quote) instead. Can you see what you might use that instead of \"\"\"?

3. Combine escape sequences and format strings to create a more complex format.

4. Remember the %r format? Combine %r with double-quote and single-quote escapes and prints them out. Compare %r with %s. Notice how %r prints it the way you'd write it in your file, but %s prints it the way you'd like to see it?
